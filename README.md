# Kth-from-End-of-Linked-List

## Difficulty: Easy
Given the head of a linked list and the number k, Your task is to find the kth node from the end. If k is more than the number of nodes, then the output should be -1.

Examples

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9, k = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The given linked list is 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9. The 2nd node from end is 8.

Input: LinkedList: 10->5->100->5, k = 5
Output: -1
Explanation: The given linked list is 10->5->100->5. Since 'k' is more than the number of nodes, the output is -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).
